# santorini

The game rules of the game Santorini can be found here: https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/fc/ec/5d-santorini-rulebook.pdf

This version of the game only enables the 2-player feature and human role instead of Gods (so only the first page of the rulebook is relevant).

When running the game, you will have to choose two types of players. Under the folder "others", humanPlayer enables you to play the game while randomPlayer is a player who will randomly choose from available moves.
valeriePlayer under the folder "valerie" uses the minimax algorithm to select moves.
